# **DBSCAN Clustering on Mall Customers Dataset**

## **Introduction**
Clustering is a crucial aspect of unsupervised machine learning that helps uncover hidden patterns within data. In this project, we implement the **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** algorithm to analyze customer behavior using the **Mall Customers Dataset**.  
The motivation behind this project is to gain insights into customer segments based on their **annual income** and **spending score**, which can help businesses design targeted marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.  
Unlike traditional clustering algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN excels at identifying clusters of varying densities and effectively handles noise in the data, making it a great fit for this analysis.

## **Requirements**
Before running the project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed. These dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

### **To install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Dependencies:**
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the **Mall Customers Dataset**, which contains the following columns:  
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.  
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.  
- **Age**: Age of the customer.  
- **Annual Income**: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.  
- **Spending Score**: A score assigned to the customer based on their spending habits (ranging from 1 to 100).

The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shwetabh123/mall-customers). The analysis focuses on **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.

## **Usage**
Follow these steps to execute the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd DBSCAN-Clustering-Project
   ```

2. **Prepare the environment**:
   Install the dependencies using `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the example script**:
   Use the example script to preprocess the dataset, run DBSCAN, and visualize the results:
   ```bash
   python examples/example_usage.py
   ```

## **Results**
The DBSCAN algorithm was applied to cluster customers based on **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**. After data preprocessing and scaling, the following clusters were identified:

### **Key Insights:**
1. **Clusters Detected**: The DBSCAN algorithm identified clusters with varying densities. Outliers (noise points) were also identified, represented by the color black in the visualization.
2. **Visualization**:  
   Below is a scatter plot of the results, showing **Annual Income (scaled)** vs. **Spending Score (scaled)**, where different colors represent distinct clusters:

3. **Business Interpretation**:
   - Customers with **high income** and **high spending scores** can be targeted for premium products or loyalty programs.  
   - Customers with **low income** but **high spending scores** may benefit from budget-friendly offers.  
   - **Outliers** represent unique cases, such as occasional or infrequent shoppers, and can be further analyzed separately.



## **Future Scope**
- Expand the analysis by including **Age** and **Gender** for multi-dimensional clustering.  
- Experiment with alternative clustering algorithms like **HDBSCAN** for better performance with larger datasets.  
- Develop a web interface to allow users to upload custom datasets and perform clustering interactively.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how the DBSCAN algorithm can be used to extract meaningful insights from customer data, providing a strong foundation for designing data-driven marketing strategies. DBSCAN's ability to handle noise and identify arbitrarily shaped clusters makes it an excellent choice for real-world datasets.
